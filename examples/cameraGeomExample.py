# * To specify a particular detector, specify the target coordinate system as a CameraSys
#   with the specified detectorName filled in (e.g. use detector.makeCameraSys).
#   This is faster than finding a detector, and the resulting point is allowed to be off the detector.
# * To have the Camera find a detector, specify the target coordinate system as a CameraSysPrefix
#   (e.g. cameraGeom.PIXELS). Camera will search for a detector that overlaps the point.
#   If it finds exactly one detector then it will use that detector, and you can figure
#   out which detector it used from the detector name in the returned CameraPoint.
#   If it finds no detectors, or more than one detector, then it will raise an exception.
